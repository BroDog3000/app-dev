# Transformers
## all the transformer series by Michael Bay

Since I was a kid, this has been my favorite series since I have a passion for mechanical objects such as cars, tanks, planes, etc..
The amount of action this series have makes it exciting with optimus prime cool lines which is inspiring and makes my hype.
